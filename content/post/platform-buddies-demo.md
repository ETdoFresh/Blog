This project was created for the sole purpose to debug a web-socket problem. There's really nothing to this toy except to see little scribble guys jump around together.

## The Issue

I was trying to help reproduce an error I was getting on my Kasteroids project. I saw that there was an open issue on GitHub found here: [https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/33279](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/33279 "https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/33279")

I was able to reproduce the problem in v0.0.5 and post the fix v0.0.6 and is the current build of the game as of this post. Here's the repository:

## What Now?

Well, nothing really. I'm not going to maintain it, but thought it'd be nice just to keep the server alive and running in case anyone wanted to test out jumping around on a pointless server for no reason! :p
