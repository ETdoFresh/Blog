Hi! I have realized I have not been writing in my blog. At all!

So, I decided to go crazy and switch from Wordpress to Ghost as my blogging platform! Hope it pays off! I'll be working slowly but surely porting my old blog posts over here.

So, what have I been up to? Well, I really want to start putting myself out there digitally. So, I'm preparing steps to get out there. I also want to start tagging my content. I want to write smaller, more meaningful posts that are hopefully easier to find... we'll see if that can be done.

Anyway, besides that, I'm also working on Kasteroids as a personal project and 2D Co-Creative Map Editor as a research project. Wish me luck! - ET
