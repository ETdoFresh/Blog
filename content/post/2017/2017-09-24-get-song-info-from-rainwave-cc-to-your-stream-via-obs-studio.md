I love listening to video game remix music atÂ <https://ocr.rainwave.cc>, and wanted a way I can show on my stream the information about the current song being played.

I'm sure there are probably easier ways to do this, but I made a small windows GUI Executable using C#/WPF that will download Album, Title, and Art from rainwave's API, and I wanted to share it with you.

Download the project here:

  * Windows Binary:Â [SongInfo.zip][2]Â (232 KB)
  * Windows Source: [SongInfoSource.zip][3]Â (1085 KB)

This program will output files like Album.txt, Title.txt, Art.jpg that you can use in OBS as shown below.
