Larry 'Mac' Craters just got assigned to work the Cargo Bay on the CS Valkyrie. Help Larry get the cargo to the intended destinations and enjoy all that lack of appreciation from your superiors!

Cargo Bay 5 was created by Sink Lab Studios. It mixes Sokoban and Bomberman into a zanny puzzle game. The game consists of solving puzzles by pushing, pulling, or bombing crates.
