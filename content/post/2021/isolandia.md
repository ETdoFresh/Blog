## Game Description

https://nauticalnoodle.itch.io/isolandia

A 48-hour game jam where you walk around an isometric world.

This is my first isometric game. I didn't really know what I was doing when I started out. So, that's why there is no story really to the game. It was more of an experiment to see if I can make a game loop using isometric tiles and 3d characters. And I think it came together nicely!
