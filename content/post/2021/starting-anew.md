For the last 11 years I have worked and studied at the University of New Orleans (UNO). I started in 2010 and left today, July 23, 2021.

I was petrified to put in my two weeks. What will people say? How disappointed is everyone going to be in me? These are people I have known for so long! I can't believe I'm going to leave them for my own personal journey. I know I'm going to let some of them down. And, in some ways I have, I know I have.

However, all those worries were squelched with the overwhelming support I got from all my friends from UNO. They were happy I was following my dreams. They were happy I found my passion. Their support led me to be happy and confident in the decision I was making.

My path is quite unclear from here... but I know I am going to try my damnedest to make this work. I want to create impactful experiences for people that play my games. I just needed to get away from the grind for a while so I can clear my head and figure out where this path leads. 

The plan, for the time being, is participate in a lot of game jams, go to gamedev meetups, meet people, figure out my role in my current projects, and figure out how to make this work so I can do this long-term. I may need to sneak some R-and-R in there, because, phew what a crazy last 1-2 years it has been.

For anyone that actually reads this... I'll keep you posted how "pursuing your dreams" goes for me! But, as of right now, it's a mix of uncertainty and exhilaration! Take care! - ET
