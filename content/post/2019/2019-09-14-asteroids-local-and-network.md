I spent most of my Summer and beginning of Fall working on Multiplayer in Unity. I've built my own network engine, I've tried Photon BOLT, and Photon PUN. This is my test game for testing various network engines and a project to keep my "muscle memory" of making a game from start to finish. [A skill I easily tend to lose if I don't keep it up!]
