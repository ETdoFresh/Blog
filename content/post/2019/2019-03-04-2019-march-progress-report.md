Alright, definitely slowed down this February. Still doing alright, but I got sick for about 10 days , and then sprained my ankle. So training has been bad the second half of the month!

  * Submitted my camera ready version of my Police Use of Force paper! Woot!
  * Been on autopilot mostly, doing the work/school thing... Homeworks, projects, programming, etc.
  * Completed a simple [3d project][1] this weekend that I've been wanting to do for a little while now!

As for what's coming this month, I really want to get back on track on dieting and running. Got a trip this month to GDC and need to keep pushing myself to be the best me I can be!
