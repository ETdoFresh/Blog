Hi! I have realized I have not been writing in my blog. At all! So, what have I been up to? Well, I really want to start putting myself out there digitally. So, I&#8217;m preparing steps to get out there. I also want to start tagging my content. For example, this post is a general update. So what I want WordPress to do is create a link for the tag above and tag this post with that tag. That way, I can pull up all the posts I want that use this tag. I want to be able to browse topics as I write about them&#8230; I&#8217;m going to try and use some plug ins. We&#8217;ll see how that goes. Anyway, besides that, I&#8217;m also working on Kasteroids as a personal project and 2D Co-Creative Map Editor as a research project. Wish me luck! &#8211; ET
