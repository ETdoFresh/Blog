## The Current Situation

I&#8217;m a computer programmer and a computer science master&#8217;s/PhD student. I&#8217;ve decided to try an experiment to replace my existing 13.3&#8243; HP Spectre x360 Windows Laptop (awesome laptop by the way) with the 12.9&#8243; iPad Pro 2 . I plan to write a few blog posts that summarize my experience.

As far as Apple products go, I have an iPhone 7 Plus. It&#8217;s my only Apple product, and it has been a good purchase. I play games, shop, call, text, finance, and browse the web on it. Great compact device which is with me at all times.

    My work computer setup
  </p>
</div>

For all my other computer needs, I have all Microsoft Windows 10 computers. At home, I have a duel screen setup. At work, I have a tri screen setup. At the lab, I have a dual screen setup. All desktops with Windows 10, and a quite nice setup for a programmer! I just sit down and go!

The downside is that I&#8217;m pretty tethered to 3 locations. I have tried to obtain an on-the-go device, my HP Spectre x360. It&#8217;s a nice, portable, and powerful machine, but I am not nearly as efficient on the laptop as I am with my desktop setups.

So what am I using? Here is a list, in no particular order of my most used software:

  * Unity3d
  * Visual Studio 2017
  * Eclipse Kepler for Java
  * Chrome
  * Outlook
  * Office (Word, Office, Excel)
  * SourceTree (git)
  * Tortoise SVN
  * Microsoft Remote Desktop (Work)
  * Gimp
  * Inkscape
  * 3ds Max

Side note: For entertainment I also have an LG SmartTV and a Windows 7 Media Center laptop hooked up to the TV which has AirServer installed.
