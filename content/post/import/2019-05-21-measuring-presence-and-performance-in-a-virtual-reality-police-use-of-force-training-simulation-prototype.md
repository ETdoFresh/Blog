In this paper we describe a virtual reality training simulation designed to help police officers learn use of force policies. Our goal is to test a training simulation prototype by measuring improvements to presence and performance. If successful, this can lead to creating a full-scale virtual reality narrative training simulation. The simulation uses a planner-based experience manager to determine the actions of agents other than the participant. Participants’ actions were logged, physiological data was recorded, and the participants filled out questionnaires. Player knowledge attributes were authored to measure participants’ understanding of teaching materials. We demonstrate that when participants interact with the simulation using virtual reality they experience greater presence than when using traditional screen and keyboard controls. We also demonstrate that participants’ performance improves over repeated sessions.
