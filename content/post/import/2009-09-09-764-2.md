Dear Blog,

It&#8217;s been a pretty good day and just trying to think about what to say. I&#8217;ve told Mr. Kovacs that I&#8217;m leaving the house in about a month or so. Trying to decide what to leave behind seems to be more of a challenge than I thought. I know which TV he wants, but I&#8217;m not sure which one I want. I&#8217;ll look up prices, and just take a look at both TV&#8217;s and see how I feel.

Anyway, I was up late last night, and was Striker of the Day before I went to sleep. Yay for me! Shouldn&#8217;t do that anymore, cause past 3AM is way too late to stay up.

It&#8217;s around 11PM now, and I think it&#8217;ll be a good time to go to sleep. Sorry, not much to say&#8230; but it&#8217;s been a pretty blah day. I read more of Jim Cramer&#8217;s [Real Money][1], and last thing I read was Market Orders are a rip off. The margin is just more commission going to the broker (or something like that). Limit orders are the answer. So today, I didn&#8217;t but any stocks, but I decided to limit my selling to crazy prices that I desire (not recommended by Cramer [as of yet in my reading]). I&#8217;ll read some more, and learn much more, I hope! Good night blog!

&#8211; E.T.
