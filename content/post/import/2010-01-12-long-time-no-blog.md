Dear Blog,

Wow! Long time no blog! I really wanted to blog since the New Year, but something has kept me from doing it. I blame it on games! Right! Games! The one thing in my life that I was supposed to be striving for and making a career for myself has been the one thing that has been my down fall these last two months! Darn you very fun games!

So what games? Well, I&#8217;ll tell you my life sucker! It&#8217;s [Team Fortress 2][1]! Oh man! That game has leeched onto my life and sucked every free second out of it. I can&#8217;t believe I let it do it too! I have a very addicting game personality, and if something is too fun for even a little while, I play! The game has 9 different classes, and with all the people out there, the dynamic is soo different. And me, I have the "I want to be the best player" bug, and I keep playing and playing until I either think I&#8217;m the best player or I just give up! It&#8217;s been a wonderful distraction, but a horrible motivator. I&#8217;m stagnant all night playing this game, where I could be programming or learning something new. Wow, I never thought I would talk bad about games, but it really hurting me at this point in my life where I want to go somewhere! Make money! Do something creative!

Ugh! I beat myself up and up, and today, I deleted the game off my computer. It took me 2 weeks of actually saying it to myself before it finally happened! Slippery road I&#8217;m on. Anyway, I&#8217;m shaking off the cob-webs, getting ready to get back to work! But it took way too long. But ergo, I must try! Try as hard as I can, because regret is the one useless waste of energy in life, and why waste good energy? Let&#8217;s go! Let&#8217;s get a move on to my life&#8217;s mission. Let&#8217;s put down the controller (or keyboard and mouse) and let&#8217;s make some games (and pick up that same keyboard and mouse)!

To start, I&#8217;ll play around with this nice Apple Ipod Touch 3rd Generation. I wonder if I should try forcing my programs onto my device, or cough up some money, and just be 100% legit on this. The answer is obvious I know, but it&#8217;s hard to break old habits. It also comes with this Nike Program which I&#8217;ll try out. It tell you distance you ran, etc. Can&#8217;t wait to give it a shot!
