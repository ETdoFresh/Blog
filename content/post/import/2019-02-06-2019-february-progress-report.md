2019 is off to a great start. I think I&#8217;ll just list out good stuff, and then list out what I should focus on this month.

  * Did all my training runs/jogs for Crescent City Classic
  * Been keeping track of my input calories into my body using MyFitnessPal
      * Lost ~6-7lbs in the process of the above
  * Planned or planning various trips
      * GDC [indie pass] in March 2019 @ San Francisco
      * FLAIRS-32 in May 2019 @ Saratosa, FL
          * (OMG, my paper got accepted, I get to go somewhere!)
      * Family Summer trip, IDK if it&#8217;ll be Europe or elsewhere, but definitely planning on having my mom, Colleen, and I together with my bro&#8217;s family somewhere on this planet!
  * KonMari Method of Tidying up! What!?!?
      * Wow&#8230; this one hit me like a bag of bricks from left field.
      * I&#8217;m at Lesson 1: Clothing.
      * I&#8217;m deciding what clothing I will take with me into my future
          * Does this clothing Spark Joy in me?
      * Thank the clothing that I will not bring to my future for the lessons it taught me or good times we had
          * Wow! This second point really helped alleviate soo much guilt I have about me letting go of some of my old clothes 
          * (even some I have never worn before!)
  * Made a funny little game in 48 hours called Home Wrecker! at Global Game Jam 2019

So, hmmm, here are the things I&#8217;ll focus on this month&#8230;

  * Of course, get a 2nd picture of me with all red X&#8217;s on my February training guide
  * Start some seed projects where, hopefully, some will bloom into beautiful fruit this year
  * Speaking of gardening&#8230;. clean up my garden
  * Finish KonMari Method Lesson 1 and start Lesson 2: Books
  * Make time to enjoy da&#8217; Mardi Gras!
  * Learn every chance I get!
  * Find the time to laugh and love every once in a while!
