I am the primary Unity developer on the Police Use of Force Prototype Simulation. It is a research project I've worked on with the [Narrative Intelligence Laboratory](https://nil.cs.uno.edu/projects/) at the [University of New Orleans](http://www.uno.edu). You control a Police Officer in either VR or Keyboard/Mouse controls learning Use of Force policies.
