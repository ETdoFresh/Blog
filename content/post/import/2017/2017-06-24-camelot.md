I am 1 of 3 developers on Camelot, a fully customizable system to test Narrative Engines. It is a research project I've worked on with the <a href="https://nil.cs.uno.edu/projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Narrative Intelligence Laboratory</a> at the <a href="http://www.uno.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">University of New Orleans</a>. Depending on the configuration, this is either a first person behind a shoulder game or overhead point-and-click adventure game. Characters perform actions depending on the narrative system running behind the scenes.
