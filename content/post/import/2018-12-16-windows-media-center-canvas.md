A Windows Media Center front end in HTML5/JavaScript. It's hard to find a good extender for the Windows Media Center. Hence I built one that connects to ServerMCE. However, websites cannot connect directly to a TCP Socket, hence I made a WebSocket bridge that sends commands from browser to TCP Socket using WebSockets.

*EDIT: Project has been shelved due to school starting.*
