Dear Blog,

My bro invited me to use [Google Voice][1]. This is a cool little service that tries to replace your old voicemail service.

**What I expected**

Well, like my voicemail at my old engineering job, I knew I&#8217;d probably be able to play through the computer. It was cool, but was it worth Google taking over my voicemail just for that?

**What I didn&#8217;t expect**

It doesn&#8217;t clutter your email if you don&#8217;t want it to. There&#8217;s a seperate "Inbox" of voicemails on the Google Voice homepage. If you want to be notified by email, it&#8217;ll send you an email with a direct link to play the voicemail. On top of that, Google Voice transcribes the voicemail! That&#8217;s awesome. So, not only do you get a link to the audio file, it sends you the text of what the person said! Now that&#8217;s nice! Now I&#8217;m seriously considering leaving my old voicemail to go with Google.

**The setup**

Not hard. These are the steps I went through (if memory serves me correctly):

  * Gave google my phone number
  * Google gave me a two digit code
  * They called me and asked for the two digit code
  * Google Voice account got created and voicemail # was given to me
  * I was given a number to type to switch my current voicemail to Google voicemail
  * Changed the settings so that I get an email (you can also get SMS, or text messages, of the call) when a voicemail is recieved.

I know somewhere in there I was able to record my greeting before I got the voicemail account, but I forget. Anyway, setup was easy, and I had Google Voice.

**Conclusion**

Well, I don&#8217;t know for sure how I feel about Google having access to my voicemail, but the features are darn cool! Maybe if Sprint would offer this to me, I can use them instead of Google. Give it a try, and if you need an invite, I think I can send them!
