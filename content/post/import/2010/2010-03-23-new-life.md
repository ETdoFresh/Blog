    Dear Blog,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Did you know that life can be bought for only a few bucks? What!? Alright, well, if you are looking for a cool activity to do with a loved one (spouse, child, girlfriend, whatever), why don't you create some new life?

    Colleen and I were at the grocery store, and I decided I needed some mint. I could buy 10 &#8211; 15 leaves for 2.99 or I could buy a plant for 2.99. I went with the latter (and got two!). Well this was great! Colleen also bought a upside-down strawberry garden that starts from seeds.

    Anyway, then it started getting serious. We cleaned out this huge weed pile we had by the A/C unit, and placed pine needles there and planted flowers. So cheap (like $0.89 for each plant). I also trimmed the fig tree, because it was getting a little to estate hungry (took up way too much room).

    Then we bought seeds. We bought a little DIY mini green house, and seeds for all around $10 &#8211; $15. I think just growing mint and herbs pays for itself, but with patience, I'm going to try and grow many different things from seeds. I printed cool little graphics and taped it to the edge of the green house (plastic box) so I can tell what's what!

    Hopefully we can make beautiful flowers, herbs, and vegetables grow in our backyard. But it's a cheap hobby (if you choose it to be) and you make life in your very own backyard (or your patio pot). I guess I gotta be prepared to take care of them once they start sprouting, until they are strong enough to survive on their own.
