    Dear Blog,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I just read an article called <a href="http://kokugamer.com/2010/03/27/software-piracy-its-not-right-but-how-do-we-fix-it/">Software Piracy – It's Not Right, but How Do We Fix It?</a>
  </p>

    The answer is punishment against those that do it. He says that 75% of people will stop right away (stop dead). LOL! Are you serious? There have been attacks already, so it's been done! Piracy lives, punishment fails. Remember Napster? Remember KaZaa? See PirateBay? Piracy is like a weed, you clip it, it only grows back nastier and heavier than ever.
  </p>

    Sorry, but if I was 100% against piracy, punishment is too uncreative of a solution. Creative solutions could be the game developers themselves distributing "fake" versions of the game on Pirate Bay or something that will delete your save games at a certain date. Haha! Some hackers would be pissed! Maybe have a renaming function in the game for those implementing constant online protection. Like the main character could be renamed <em>IHeartPinkPonies</em> and the end boss could be <em>PinkPony</em>, or something ridiculous like that.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Anyway, what I'm trying to say, punishment will scatter the pirates, but pissing them off will bring them out. But not only that, it may burn them out as they get frustrated with accidently downloading "junk".
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As of right now... it's too easy. Jump on a torrent site, start up the program to see if it works, and bam! You got new software! The comments on these torrent trackers help too! They have people saying, "yup, it works" or "don't download this, it's junk".
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you want to hurt piracy, think outside the box and be creative. I think it'll take a pirate to hurt the pirates. But either way, piracy will live.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Last thought: If people would spend half their energy on doing something (creative) about piracy that they use complaining about piracy, I think the whole industry would be somewhere else right now.
