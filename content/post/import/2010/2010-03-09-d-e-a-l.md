    <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/">Four Hour Workweek</a> was an interesting read. I have some friends that say it was an OK book, and other&#8217;s say it was complete bologna (in nice terms). Anway, I gave it a read, and it was a good self-help book to get ya motivated.

    <strong>DEAL</strong> is the acronym the majority of the chapters seem to go through. <strong>Define</strong> what you want (cost, style, quantity, etc.). <strong>Eliminate</strong> all the excess activities that don&#8217;t get you results. The author mentioned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto&#8217;s Principle</a> where 80% of what you are doing is only giving you 20% your output, and vice versa, 20% of what you are doing is giving you 80% of your output. <strong>Automate</strong> your tasks so you don&#8217;t have to be part of the machine you call your job. The author challenges everyone to hire a person in India or wherever most economical to gain experience not only automating some mundane tasks, but to gain experience &#8220;bossing&#8221; someone else around. <strong>Liberate</strong> your life! Find out what to do with the free time you have. Travel, Vagabond, etc.

    Good stuff, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be able to follow in his footsteps exactly. I like to work, and not really sure if I can define what I want exactly or eliminate all the things I think bring me happiness just yet. Once I get fed up with my career again, I may give this a shot.
