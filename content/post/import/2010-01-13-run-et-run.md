Dear blog,

Brr. Another cold night in New Orleans. I have a [schedule][1] to keep to run the [Crescent City Classic][2]. Goodness, I can&#8217;t see how I&#8217;ll be able to train for 3 more months! But I will along with other things!

</p>

So I&#8217;m getting into this thing called [Nike+][3]. I just purchased the [Nike+ Sensor][4] online for $18.94 from J&Rs and bought the [Marware Sportsuit Sensor][5] for $9.95 after shipping. It&#8217;s this sensor that you put on your shoe that let&#8217;s you know how far you ran and includes sign up to a site where you can share your info with your friends. Cool stuff! I&#8217;ll see how it goes and post my stuff maybe here on the blog too!

I&#8217;ve been getting work done, and feeling good! I hope to continue on this trend. Motivation = Good Feeling! Let&#8217;s keep it up!

&#8211; E.T.
