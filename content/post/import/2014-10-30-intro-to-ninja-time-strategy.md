This game is quite different. It&#8217;s not one of those games I&#8217;ve been dying to make for many years. On the flip-side, I decided to try to make a game on a &#8220;whim&#8221;. I also was very interested in HTML5 before I started, so this was a perfect opportunity.

<!--more-->I thought of a premise that is light and humorous. A ninja that goes back through time and destroys allÂ bases and armies that may have taken players 30 minutes to an hour to build in a typical real-time strategy game. In a flick of a few shurikens, sword, and ninja bombs, bases and armies would be destroyed. No need to build bases. Just one ninja vs the world!

I was simply having fun when I made this game. There was also a cool mechanic that accidentally came about. A sword that is always sticking out of the ninja where swinging the mouse around swings the sword. The faster you swing, the more damage you do. Fun!

Here&#8217;s the link to the game and source if interested.
