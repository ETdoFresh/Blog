Dear Blog,

I still have to update blog posts TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 2009 to THURSDAY, JUNE 25, 2009, but should be done shortly. I&#8217;m basically setting it up so that when you click a pic, you get the full resolution (available on picasa) and that they all use HTML (especially <p>).

Phew. Anyway. Went to my bud&#8217;s house to watch Farve and the Vikings destroy the Cowboys. Can&#8217;t wait &#8217;til New Orleans gets to do the same to them, but that&#8217;s 7 days from now.

So what did I really do today?&#8230; basically just the title of this blog. I always feel guilty watching TV, but Colleen says she does not! She says "I put in an honest 8 hours a day each work a week, so when I have free time, I don&#8217;t have a problem watching TV." I got to give it to the girl, she&#8217;s right! But I don&#8217;t put in normal hours, and don&#8217;t really keep track (as of yet) how many hours I&#8217;m putting into projects. So I feel like, "shoot, if I have free time, I should be working on life altering career that I&#8217;m trying to build instead of watching TV". It drives me nuts! I can&#8217;t enjoy a free minute without being haunted. Well. sometimes I can, sometimes I can&#8217;t. I get this feeling the most when I sit on my couch at home! The comfiest place is where I feel the most guilty. Come on! Anyway, I&#8217;m not worried, cause I will continue to strive for my goal, and ultimately get what I want! Isn&#8217;t that what we all want&#8230; for E.T. to get what he wants? Haha, kidding&#8230; we all desire something, and we all want our goals to come true. Let&#8217;s make sure we either get it done or move on&#8230; no in-betweenie weenies!
