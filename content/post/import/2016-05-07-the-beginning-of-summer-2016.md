Hey everyone, today is the first day I tell myself, I will spend at least 10 minutes to write a blog entry a few times a week. Some may be content packed, but some may be like this&#8230; bare!

Summer 2016 is packed for me, here are the things I&#8217;ll be doing:

  * Work with SinkLab Games
  * First Thesis class at University of New Orleans
  * Full-time employee at University of New Orleans
  * Write the other 14 weeks of Honest Abe Post-Mortem
  * Perhaps even polish Honest Abe so that it can be released on Apple ios!

I don&#8217;t know if I can fit anything else in. We&#8217;ll see! Wish me luck!
