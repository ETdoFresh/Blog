Dear Blog,

What!? 3.5 years later! Where did the time go!? Man&#8230; I blink and I&#8217;m in what seems to be another galaxy. Too much to talk about, so I&#8217;m going to skip all of it. Well, almost all of it. Colleen and I got married April 6, 2013. It was an awesome wedding and I got a great partner!

So now&#8230; I&#8217;m still someone who wants to make games. I&#8217;m still someone who hasn&#8217;t made a game. I&#8217;m still someone! So, I&#8217;m here trying to figure out what in the hell I&#8217;m going to do with my life. I&#8217;m 31 years old now&#8230;.. 31! As I write this, the lyrics to Smashing Pumpkins Disarmed pops up in my head!

I used to be a little boy  
So old in my shoes  
And what I choose is my choice  
Whats a boy supposed to do?  
The killer in me is the killer in you  
My love  
I send this smile over to you

Hmmm, random, but meaningful. Even the killer part, as I think the killer in me is the killer in Colleen. So, do I just send that smile over to her? Maybe there&#8217;s more to that song, but whatever, getting off track.

Unity and C# are hands down the tools I want to use. So, I discovered that after a long and very drawn out search. I&#8217;m also in a Game Design class right now at UNO where I&#8217;m finally learning the difference between Game Development and Game Design. Both are cool, game design seems more universal and more important than game development&#8230; ok, maybe not more important, but universal and artistic! Game development can be done by someone provided the rules and description of all the objects in almost any language.

So, here I am, lots of friends, great family, but alone&#8230;. alone to pursue my individual dream&#8230; as it should be. Should it be!? Too many questions, not enough answers.

I&#8217;m here to get answers. I&#8217;m here to make plans. I want to revive my company "Drag &#8216;N&#8217; Dream", although it never really did go anywhere. I want to make a $#%##$ #@$@$%#% GAME!!!! I&#8217;ve been down tonight, and as soon as I got on the computer, I just got angry. I&#8217;m angry at myself. I&#8217;m angry at my situation. I don&#8217;t have infinite time to do what I want. I have very limited time. These windows are only getting smaller. The "real" career gets in the way, "health", "wellness", all this vitally important stuff&#8230;.. but it&#8217;s not important to my dream&#8230;. just to the temple (aka my body) that allows me to make choices and receive the joys of life. Siiigggghhhhhh, I don&#8217;t know how to proceed. I want to drop it all, move into a little cabin somewhere in the middle of no where, have a simple life where survival and money is out of the picture, and all I&#8217;m doing is making a game. I won&#8217;t be allowed to leave until the game is complete. I need a year. Someone, please just give me a year of time without having to worry about anything. That&#8217;s what I want now, and can&#8217;t say that&#8217;s all I want&#8230;. because what I want after the year is over may be totally different. I can make a game. I have the knowledge. I&#8217;m ready! I just need the time now&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. aghhhhh. OK, no more anger, no more complaining. Just doing.

All I can do is all I can do. Just do it!
