Another year in the books! Time to reflect and time to look forward...

### Mirror, mirror of the year...

Here are some of the key things I remember from this year...

  * 2018 started with some intense biking for about 2 weeks
  * Mardi Gras spent with my prima Pilly, her family, tia Patty, and tio Gabriel
      * Experienced my first car break in with the family
      * Really enjoyed the sharing of our feelings at the family table with drinks, laughter, and tears
  * Ran the Crescent City Classic with a bad time of ~1:20hr
  * Played many, many Racquetball games with my friends
  * Cut my long hair!
  * Celebrated often in restaurants... probably most I ever have ever
      * Been a great way to connect with my mom and get me out my shell
  * Completed two classes and another year of research with NIL
  * Went to my first academic conference (AIIDE 2018)
      * Presented a playable experience, and participated in a panel
      * Went to Canada!! Wow! Felt like North USA! :p
  * Spent some great days with my brother, nephews, and sis-in-law various times, Thanksgiving being the freshest in my memory!
  * Implemented Target X Integrations at work almost all by myself.
  * Happy I was able to see many family members and friends this year.
  * Started various computer projects (listed on this site).
  * Continue to have a wonderful relationship which I always seem to take for granted with my wife Colleen.

### Cruise Control Settings for 2019

So before I go on what I want to change about myself, I guess I should start with what I'll continue to do...

  * Take my last classes towards the PhD! Yay!
      * Finally get my Computer Science Masters
  * Crescent City Classic again... I really want to finish < 1:00hr
  * Find time to celebrate life with family and friends... always...
  * Starting and finishing projects.... for the rest of my days I hope!
  * Start on some Workday Transition!

### Changes for 2019

  * Be more confident in my decisions...
      * I always tend to overthink what I do.
      * I worry too much about others feelings.
      * I don't put enough emphasis on what I feel.
  * Lead Projects I take on...
      * No longer the days I am a follower...
      * I'm a leader, I need to start acting like one...
      * I must first take charge of myself (above)
      * [Probably will not apply to my day job, lol]
