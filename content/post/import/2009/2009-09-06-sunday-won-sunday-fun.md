Dear Blog,

Only got one picture for the blog tonight, but had a nice day today.

I had some pancakes in the morning (like 1pm, hah). And had some tilapia, veggies, and starwberry water. Yum! But the kitchen is a bit of a mess, my fault.  
[<img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 250px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yEPuIWl8ybE/SqR68bxAhSI/AAAAAAAAAfQ/ePF61dJEUm4/s400/CIMG0001.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5378559033651266850" />][1]I was over at Coconut Beach today, and Rebecca had a lot of people over there! We had a 6-on-6 game going a few times, even though it was drizzling, then rain. I really like volleyball because it's exercise, and I'm OK at it with room to improve. I like improving my skills in everything that I do. Isn't life a quest to become the best you can be and help as many people as you can?

I played some Mario Stikers Charged today, and got matched up with Rank 1 player, Rod. today. I won! I never beat a superior ranked players! So I'm all excited tonight. I am trying to sleep early tonight so I can wake up at a decent hour. So, on that note, good night!

â€“ E.T.
