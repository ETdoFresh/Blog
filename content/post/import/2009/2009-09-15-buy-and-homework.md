Dear Blog,

[Buy and Homework][1] is the title of this blog because I&#8217;m ready, thanks to Cramer! I&#8217;m ready to invest&#8230; and I&#8217;m ready to do some smart investing. Since I&#8217;m in my 20&#8217;s, I&#8217;ll go ahead and use 20% of my money to make speculative, more risky investments.

I was up all night finishing up the [Real Money][2] book. I may decide to summarize the book in my next blog entry to help me remember.

Here&#8217;s step 145, but I managed to reach step 150 of 173&#8230; which means, I&#8217;m done modeling! I&#8217;m soo happy! I just have to do some texturing, and I&#8217;m done with this model. I totally started to understand how to model objects. Maybe I need to do the last section, which may take some more time. But I think I have enough knowledge to make a simple game.
