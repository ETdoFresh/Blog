Dear Blog,

Geez, it&#8217;s been so long since I blogged last. Life was too fast when I got back home from Sweden, and I could not keep up.

So what happened this past month? Hmmm, let&#8217;s see&#8230;. my friends Jonathan and Brandi got married. I switched my Wii from playing backup DVDs to loading all games from a USB hard drive (may have been done before, but now cleaned up). I&#8217;ve been playing a lot of Mario Strikers lately. Been learning how to do 3D Studio Max for my game. Which leads me to developing my game. I want to develop a game&#8230; I said by end of August, but I did not setup a schedule to follow yet&#8230; so it may be more by mid September.

I&#8217;ve also started training again for the Crescent City Classic 10K Run. I&#8217;m luckily just in the speed walking stage, but soon I&#8217;ll get to jogging, and then improve my speed in jogging.

So much, so much to report. I really just need to start updating this every night. Well, Colleen&#8217;s birthday passed July 14th. We ate out with friends and it was pleasant.

Culture fest happened July 25th. It wasn&#8217;t as good as it used to be, but was still fun to record and setup for. Things I may have heard was that it was too preachy, and the performances weren&#8217;t as great this year. I agree, and it was too short. I can cut down the performances to 25 minutes! And that&#8217;s with a 5 minute power point presentation in the beginning. Anyway, lots of open ended feeling toward that event. I want to be involved in the planning and I want to perform in the next culture fest (2010).

I made (still making) the DVD for this year&#8217;s culture fest&#8230; took up a few days of my time, but no big deal. I&#8217;m also trying to gather all the DVDs from past culture fests so that we can have a collection in the Kaikan of New Orleans.

My investments are doing OK. I decided to Short Sell against two companies, and man&#8230; they started going up and up and up&#8230; which means money started going down and down and down for me. So, I cut my losses, and bought those stocks again. Not really a good time to invest against the economy, cause it&#8217;s getting a bit better now (excellent stock day today).

Hmmm, I&#8217;m out of things to report right now&#8230; but don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;ll be back with pictures&#8230;&#8230;. Oh man! Pictures! That&#8217;s what I forgot to mention. I cracked the screen of my camera! Sooo sad! I&#8217;ll post pictures of broken camera tomorrow. Once I get a new one, my posts should be more interesting.

Stop, take a second, look at where you are, look at where you want to be, and go!
