Dear blog,

I&#8217;m feeling good today. I got some volleyballing in and feeling all worked out. I really need some stress relief. I&#8217;m worried what will happen this week. I have a few things to do this week that I "volunteered" for, and always seem to be regretting what I volunteered for until the last minute. It&#8217;s never that bad&#8230; but why do I have this regret&#8230;

Again, like last post, I want to be selfish. Just in this next few years. I need to set MYSELF up, before I try and save the world&#8230; which I won&#8217;t at the pace I&#8217;m going. I say I&#8217;ll do this job, I&#8217;ll do that job when in fact, I&#8217;m not in dire need of money. However, in the situation I am, people ask me what I do&#8230; and I tell them I&#8217;m writing a video game&#8230; which is true! Sigh, anxiety, anxiety&#8230;. 

I really just need the love of that special person. I need understanding.

Anyway, quick recap of my day. Woke up around 12pm. Went over to Matt&#8217;s house and watched the Saints. We did great after sometime. But Reggie needs to run better, and not stutter, not run backwards, and not try too hard. I hope Bell is OK, because he gives us at least some type of run game. Then I played some volleyball. I beat myself up alot on the court. I want to be perfect. No mistakes. But some happened. I will improve. And then home! Ahh, a very lite dinner, a quick shower, and now I&#8217;m laying in bed and blogging. Maybe more days should be like this for me. I&#8217;ll at least get skinner quickly if I could keep this up every other day!

&#8211; E.T.
