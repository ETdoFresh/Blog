Dear Blog,

It&#8217;s been ages! I guess I have to post many pictures, since I have some now! Well, first thing is first&#8230; I modded a Wii that was updated to 4.2U. Use this [thread from GBATEMP][1], and you&#8217;ll be home free. Phew! Anyway, it&#8217;s been an eventful few weeks.

Colleen and I now own a home! Alright, Colleen owns a home, but I&#8217;ll be living there, paying rent, and doing most of the household projects! We ordered a refrigerator, and that should be coming in next week. I did my first project around the house, but I know there are much much more left!

Let&#8217;s go back two weekends ago (around the 2nd of October weekend). There was two cool things I did that weekend&#8230; first was toured the [LPD 21 USS New York][2]. Very cool stuff.

Then I went off to Brad&#8217;s bachelor&#8217;s party! They were celebrating in a very nice house in Pass Christian, MS. On the water, where we went fishing, had more than a couple drinks, and just had a very nice weekend.

Then after that, life&#8217;s been a blur because it&#8217;s been moving too fast. Colleen closed on the house on the 9th, and then we&#8217;ve been full speed ahead since. I helped Stephen put some wood floors in for two weekends, one weekend for his living room and one weekend for his bed room.

The first project I took on in the house was to remove a garden that was too close to the deck, and growing all around the A/C unit. So the pictures show that, one second we have a garden, later that day it&#8217;s gone!

And then before we ordered the refrigerator, I wanted to ensure that the spigot on the wall was indeed a water spigot. Well one screw, one picture later, we can see that it was a water spigot&#8230; but one problem! It would not close back! Not only that, after the picture, the water exploded out of the spigot, and it was no longer a small deal! Well, I called Colleen over for support and she told me to turn off the main water line. I searched desperately in the night trying to find it, and after turning my phone to it&#8217;s brightest setting and longest duration, I found the darn thing. I turned off the water, and all the water pressure slowly went away. 10 minutes later, water was no longer an issue, but the spigot still was. I ran over to the Home Depot, picked up the exact same "saddle valve" as it&#8217;s called. and replaced the whole thing. Wow! What a different it made. Not only do we have a working valve again, it looks pretty too. I want all my home repairs to go like this&#8230; well without the water disaster to begin with.

I&#8217;m still living at the Kovac&#8217;s for now, and excited about moving soon to my new house. Tons of adventures wait, and hopefully, tons of success also awaits! Well, good night, and hopefully you&#8217;ll hear from me a lot sooner&#8230; than later!
