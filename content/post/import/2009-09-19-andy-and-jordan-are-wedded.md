Dear Blog,

It&#8217;s been a crazy couple of days these past two days. I have so much to talk about, but not much to say. But, I don&#8217;t want this entry to be about what happened, but about how I felt as things were happening. So let&#8217;s go:

I feel selfish. That&#8217;s it! The only thing I felt today is selfishness. I feel like I deserve to have what I want, to accomplish my dreams, and to be anyone I want to be. I feel much of my life I live for others, and now I want to live for myself. Even as the night winded down, I accept what others want, but I never fight for what I want. Have I laid down and die? I hope not! It&#8217;s near impossible for me to say "no" to many people about many things, especially if they had a certain relationship with me in the past. I ask myself "Why can I not do what I want? Why do I programatically say &#8216;yes&#8217; to the desires of everyone? I&#8217;m not Jesus. I&#8217;m not in an enlightened state (yet). I&#8217;m not the most compassionate person in the world. But I say &#8216;yes&#8217;".

So, how can that be bad? Well, selfishness is what makes my compassion bad. After I say yes, I don&#8217;t do it. I ignore calls. I avoid the problem at all cost. I do this continuously in life. Over and over and over again. I hate it! I&#8217;m happy keeping to myself much of the time, and I&#8217;m happy trying to create wonderful things in my life. I&#8217;m unhappy when I feel forced to do things, not because others are forcing me to do them necessarily, but because I make myself want to do them. I want everyone to be happy, but I&#8217;m simply one person&#8230; and a loner at that. I conflict myself, I oppose myself, I set myself up and knock myself down.

"Man up!" says my consciousness of 26 years. "Don&#8217;t commit to things you know you won&#8217;t do."

But at the same time, this sounds like "don&#8217;t make everyone happy." But don&#8217;t I live to make everyone happy?

I get frustrated sometimes&#8230;. maybe money can buy happiness for all? Don&#8217;t you think so?

I don&#8217;t know why I get these crazy feelings, even on such momentous days like this. I am happy for my little brother, but unhappy with myself. I can do better, and I know it. I have set goals (shallow as they may be) since 2000 or earlier. I want to be lean, I want to create (a videogame), I want to explore my unexplored life. Simple as it might sounds, it has been a mountain I&#8217;ve been scaling for the last 9 years. I want to be on the peak for the 10th.

&#8211; E.T.
