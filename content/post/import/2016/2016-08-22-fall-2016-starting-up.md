Fall 2016 semester is starting up, and now I got to figure out what my priorities are. Here are my current goals and projects that I am working towards reaching/completing.

### Cargo Bay 5, Sink Lab Games

It is my first indie game that a group of us worked on together outside of the classroom. I really want to get this released, but everything else has been getting in the way. (Unity C#)

### Use of Police Force Simulation, University of New Orleans

We will use Artificial Intelligence Planner to create an intelligient simulation of an Officer dealing with a situation between mother and adult son who will not move out. (Unity C#)<!--more-->

### Principles of Computer Graphics, University of New Orleans

<a href="http://www.etdofresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Capture.png" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft wp-image-281" src="http://www.etdofresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Capture.png" alt="Capture" width="79" height="100" /></a>This is a class I am in that will discuss how computer graphics are programmed. Besides that, I am glad I get to relearn a language I learned a long time ago. (MAKEFILE C++)

### Registrar's Office, University of New Orleans

<a href="http://www.etdofresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/13131232_1258715814143403_3006957500933065802_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignright wp-image-278" src="http://www.etdofresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/13131232_1258715814143403_3006957500933065802_o.jpg" alt="13131232_1258715814143403_3006957500933065802_o" width="204" height="153" /></a>Besides these projects, I also work as Director of Records and Registration and the University of New Orleans. I have many projects in this job alone. But for now, I'm just surviving, trying to keep this department happy and sane, and streamlining as many processes as I can for current and future employees of this department. (PeopleSoft Campus Solutions, SQL, SharePoint)

So, all-in-all, I have a lot on my plate. I barely have time to chill out... and when I do, I feel guilty I'm not working on at least one of the projects above. But, hey, I need to find the right balance where all of these goals get done in a timely, yet comfortable pace.

Wish me luck, and I'll do my best to keep writing!
