So it was decided! **Honest Abe** is the game, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unity</span> is going to be our platform, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">git</span> is going to be our version control! <!--more-->

So this week, we all committed to [README.md][1] on GitHub. Yup, GitHub means our game, the source, the art, the music, etc is all open for viewing right here: <https://github.com/ETdoFresh/honest-abe>

I devoted my efforts to making something right away in my role as Artist:

I first started to try to make Scott Pilgrim on the left. A bit of a fail. Then the generic body in the middle. Then a bunch of miscellaneous items such as a grave, chipmunk, canon, log cabin, etc. Then I finally made my first attempt at Abe.

Here are some of the reference images and work in progress images I used to start from:
