For Global Game Jam 2019, the theme is &#8220;What Home means to you&#8221;. We split into random groups and talked about deep things about what homes meant to us. This led to deep game ideas (which were probably too big of scope)&#8230;. Then someone at the meetup pitched a crazy idea where a house has legs and eats stuff. We loved it, and we literally took it and ran with Home Wrecker!<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">
