We have created 2D Co-Creative Map Editor (2DCCME), a tool that uses wave function collapse algorithm to learn rules about the map and imagine outputs using these rules as a human author designs a map. 2DCCME contains a Co-Create Collaborator (CCC) that show display different outputs as the human author creates a 2d tile map level. The map editor also includes tools which can aide human authors to construct new maps and interact with the collaborator. Because we are unable to determine what expectations a creator have in mind when creating a map, we use various rule sets to determine the computerâ€™s outputs. In this presentation, we demonstrate the current progress of the tool.
