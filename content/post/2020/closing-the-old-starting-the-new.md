Tonight, I decided not to store all my TODO's in TODO.md's.

I realized that I've started just having all these TODO's in each folder. This caused me more steps to start working...

> Step 1. Select a Project to Work on...  
> Step 2. Look at TODO.md and see wat I want to do...  
> Step 3. Select an Item, or back to Step 1

So, I decided to use GitHub Issues instead. This way, I see everything I have to do in one screen. Each of my tasks are there, waiting for me on all my projects. However, I had many old issues hannging out. I had to bite the bullet and admit to myself I probably won't do these. I closed out tons of issues as "wontfix". Then I added the new ones. I may have overdone it. But, hopefully, this will help me be more productive when I sit down and say, "I'm ready to work!"

Additionally, I don't know know why, but dragging stuff into "In Progress" or "Done" is quite satisfying on the project board. :)
