# Edward Thomas Garcia _MBA MS_

![](/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Garcia-Wedding-1121.jpg)

I currently work at the [University of New Orleans](http://www.uno.edu) (UNO) as a Programmer Analyst. At work, I program in PeopleSoft’s PeopleCode and SQR, Oracle SQL, and sometimes some ASP.NET (C#). I love to program and create graphics for video games. I am also enrolled at UNO as a [Graduate Computer Science Student](http://cs.uno.edu/academics/academics.php#master) where I am currently pursuing my interests in advanced topics in video games.

## Current Technical Background

Here is the software I have been using recently. Please click on the tags on the left menu bar or icons below to see related posts and works.

I have been using Unity since the beginning of 2014. My experience with C# is a little bit more extensive as I started working with XNA and C# some time ago.

HTML5’s Canvas element has been all the rage! A fast rendering element that can use a device’s GPU to render and create full fledged games without the use of third party software like Adobe Flash. It highly spiked my interest, so for my class, I created a game strictly using these two languages.

GameMaker Studio uses GML (GameMaker Language) or Drag’N’Drop functionality. GML is much more powerful and has a mixture feeling of C# and JavaScript to me.

[<img class="alignleft wp-image-126" src="http://www.etdofresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/max.png" alt="max" width="189" height="189" />](/?tag=3dsmax)[<img class="alignnone wp-image-122" src="http://www.etdofresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/23mudbox2014.png" alt="23mudbox2014" width="198" height="198" />](/?tag=mudbox)

3D Studio Max and Mudbox are a powerful combination. I have taken a few classes at UNO learning Maya. But all my skills and knowledge mostly apply to 3D Studio Max. I have just recently starting using Mudbox for it’s amazing ability to make bump maps, texture maps, and reducing polygons for models that work excellent in Unity.

Photoshop and Illustrator are great tools for modifying pictures and creating Vector art. Vector art is resolution independent, which is excellent as resolution of tablets and other devices are increasing at a speedily pace.

The amount of content that is needed for games can be daunting. What if you could start with a base model from the real world? You can with Photogrammetry! With popular software like PhotoScan and 123D Catch, a simple 2D camera with some good shots of an object can be converted into a fully textured 3d model which can be reduced, cleaned up, and polished for a final product. \[Please read disclaimers\]
