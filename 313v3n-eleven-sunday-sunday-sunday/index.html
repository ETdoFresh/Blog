                    <p>Dear Blog</p>
<p>My brother’s family came in! I know he was really excited to have his family back from Korea (I know I was happy for him!). I believe I heard that the time difference is about 14 hours. So, if it’s 10:23 PM Sunday here, then it’s 12:23 PM Monday over there. Yeah, so that equals a lot of jet lag for Taehee and my nephews</p>
<p>I did a typical family day, where we ate at McDonald’s, did a 3D puzzle, played with the kids, helped on a 2D puzzle, checked out the cool pictures from Korea, and had a nice homemade meal at night. Alex grilled some pork strips, and my mom made a tomato salad, mashed potatoes, and brownies. It was great.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I packed all my stuff, and went back to my mom’s. I gave the palm trunk in front of the house an <em>ET Zinger</em>, but I couldn’t dig this out. I’ll try again tomorrow morning. It’s just attracting bugs now.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Yesterday, my brother and I also managed to fix my mom’s DVD player with an internal DVD-ROM drive and packing peanuts. As ghetto as it may be, we repaired it, and it works now! Can’t argue with those facts!</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m giving this Mac OS X Another shot, and it seems to be working fine. It also uploads my photos to this blog since I disabled IPv6 (do it if you are having trouble!). Great! I made my first iphone program (a for loop, lol). All the other iphone developers are extremely jealous. What can I say, I’m just pro! Oh yeah, I also disabled sleep mode on my mac by <strong>sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0</strong> so I could save 2 gigs by deleting the sleep file (<strong>/private/var/vm/sleepimage</strong>) referencing <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20070302210328928">this site</a>. My space is soo limited, and I’m trying to get Adobe suite on here. It’s going to be a tight squeeze.</p>
<p>Well it’s time for bed, so good night all! Only 1.25 days until Sweden! Wow!</p>

                    <p>Dear Blog,
It’s Saturday, and what a wonderful Saturday it is! Tomorrow my brother’s wife and kids come back! Very exciting for everyone here! Well, we split all the house work between us, and got the whole house done. It looks nice now, and ready for the family.
Oh yeah, we were up soo freaking late last night just trying to get Mac OS X on my laptop. But, wow! After all those hours, and some hours today, We finally got it!</p>

                    <p>Dear Blog,
Wow! Time has passed sooo fast. I can’t believe it. Well, I woke up about 10:30 AM today and invested in some additional stocks. Not too much, but needed to add a few stocks since the stock market took a hit today.
Well, I went straight to that overgrown hedge, and I don’t know what I can do to get that out of there. It’s stuck pretty good, and a pretty good chance that I’m hitting cement or stones with my shovel.</p>
