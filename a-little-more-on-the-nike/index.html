                    <p>Dear Blog,</p>
<p>Today in the mail, I got my Nike+ Sensor, and my Nike+ Sensor Pouch (what are the chances that I’d get them the same day?).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I unpacked it, and it was so small. I liked it! I immediately put it on my shoe.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I gave it a little test run around the house, and it seemed to do an OK job. But I then put it up to the real test. I uploaded some music to my iPod Touch, typed in the distance (1.5 mi), and pressed Start! I proceeded to run 1.5 mi, and when I passed out on my back patio, I looked at the miles…. zero! What happened! I hit start? Anyway, I’ll give it another shot tomorrow. I’ll make sure it starts registering my miles before I pick up the pace.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The interface is alright. I was expecting to see more information about my &ldquo;friends&rdquo; at Nike+.com. Apparently, it’s really hard to friend anyone if you don’t share your info. I shared mine, but my bro did not. I tried &ldquo;friend&quot;ing him, but it would never let me add him. However, he could request me very easily. He switched his data to publicly available for about 1 minutes, and I saw all his jogs as status updates on his site. But when he switched it back, they all disappeared. We haven’t had a new run available to see if it only shows runs after we become friends, but I doubt it! That sucks, I was hoping to see all the cool graphs of my friends with this thing. I like where Nike+ is going, they just haven’t got there yet. I’ll still continue to use it as my personal time and distance tracker for my runs…. but I wish it was more than that!</p>

                    <p>Dear Blog,
My bro invited me to use Google Voice. This is a cool little service that tries to replace your old voicemail service.
What I expected
Well, like my voicemail at my old engineering job, I knew I’d probably be able to play through the computer. It was cool, but was it worth Google taking over my voicemail just for that?
What I didn’t expect
It doesn’t clutter your email if you don’t want it to.</p>

                    <p>Dear Blog,
I figure I’d blog about my struggles with Palm Pre battery issues after certain updates!
Where I’m Starting Off
I bought a Palm Pre, flashed a custom firmware on it (qinray 1.0.4 v2). I then used novaterm to install Dropbear which is a SSH server for my phone so that I can just PuTTy and sFTP right into it. Then I setup ez-ipudate so that I could have a static hostname for my dynamic-IP address, so I only had to type myhostname.</p>
