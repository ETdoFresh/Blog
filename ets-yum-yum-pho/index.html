                    <p>Dear Blog,</p>
<p>This entry is about my first experience making Pho. I absolutely love this Vietnamese traditional soup, and was not even remotely sure how it was made. However, I looked up some sites and recipes on the net, and I was brave enough to try. Now my pictorial story!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I split up the ingredients into two teams! The Pre-cook team, and then the post-cook team. Then I start with the Pre-cook team.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>First I take my beef bones (not very good choice of beef bones my frist time around, not even bones! I hear knuckle bone is a good choice, and will try it next time) and parboil them (boil them for 10 – 15 minutes before actually cooking). I take two yellow onions and split them in half. I do the same with the 4&rdquo; – 5&rdquo; nubbin’ of ginger. Stick them in your broiler on HI. After about 10 – 15 minutes you should have some nicely charred veggies. Your beef bones should be done too, just scoop up and scum on surface and toss that in the trash or sink.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Alright, I throw everything into the slow cooker, and I add some sugar, salt, beef broth (cause I didn’t use real bones) + water, and fish sauce. I let this cook for about 8 hours in the slow cooker on low.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Ok! 8 hours have passed and I’m ready to prepare the post-cook team. I get a nice big bowl, put some rice noodles into it. Then Itake some nice steak and slice it very thin and put it in your bowl. I chilled my steak for a little bit in the freezer so it was easier to cut thinly.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Add hot broth!!! Let is set for about 5 minutes. Mix in some lime, hoison sauce, chili sauce. If you have mint leaves and bean sprout, those are great too! EAT!</p>
<p>My first experience was near Pho quality, but I think I screwed up cause I bought the wrong kind of bones (not bones at all, just ribs with small bones in them.). The ribs also made it extra greasy, which I could feel all over my hands after eating a bowl of Pho. Colleen and I totally enjoyed eating it, and I really want to add this to something I cook often.</p>

                    <p>Dear blog,
Wow, my first night away from the Kovacs family. I moved in perhaps a day or two before Colleen is going to move in. But it’s all very exciting. Like I just posted on facebook, I noticed my senses are all heightened. I hear everything, especially traffic on Clearview, although it’s far away and very low. I also see and always focused on something, like the patterns on the ceiling, the color of the floor, the intricacies of the border in the room I am in right now.</p>

                    <p>Dear Blog,
Now I’m writing all my blog entries in DreamWeaver CS4. The design interface allows me to write some nice clean HTML without having to type paragraphor Linkand most importantly format images the way I want them! I had to disable &ldquo;Enter as Line Break&rdquo; so the rest of my blog looks all messed up as of today. I plan to go back and start editting them and rereading to get that reminiscent feeling.</p>
