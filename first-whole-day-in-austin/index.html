                    <p>Dear Blog,</p>
<p>This is my <strong>first</strong> entry, and I’m not really sure what I want to say on here. This will be my personal journal, where I will keep my life up to date (and eventually create my own blog system and my own site). But for now, this is where I’ll start.</p>
<p>Well today is officially my first whole day here in Austin. I came in yesterday afternoon, and I’ll mention briefly what I did then. My brother, my mom, and me went to Smokey Moe’s (a local BBQ place) and H-E-B. We bought lots of groceries. But we got home, and basically settled down. I stayed up way too late working on my computer. I was getting <!-- raw HTML omitted -->clickinclock<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.com ready to be worked on, on my laptop. I guess I went to sleep at 3:00 AM.</p>
<p>So now it’s June 11, 2009. I woke up around 10:30 AM. I had a bagel, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->cream<!-- raw HTML omitted --> cheese, and smoked salmon for breakfast. Yum yum. Then I turned on my computer, and started playing. Well, I really want to buy the Palm <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pre<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but there may be some road blocks. So I did some research. It looks like the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SERO<!-- raw HTML omitted --> plan will definitely not accept Palm <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pre<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as the plan. You can’t even use the Sprint Swap <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ESN<!-- raw HTML omitted --> site to get it working, and customer services will not help either (according to forums online). So what now? Well, I guess there is always <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ESN<!-- raw HTML omitted --> cloning… but cloning may lead to fraud, hence it is illegal. But I wonder if <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ESN<!-- raw HTML omitted --> hard swapping is legal? Telephone company will not know that you have a certain phone, and you own both anyway, so why not just swap <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ESN<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if you have the ability to. It took me a few hours to find this, and then my brother calls me up, and mentions that the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pre<!-- raw HTML omitted --> may only have 4 hours of standby time. Unbelievable! How can you call that a cell phone. You should call it a LAN phone using a cellular signal!</p>
<p>Anyway, I downloaded Adobe <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dreamweaver<!-- raw HTML omitted --> CS4 30-day free trial so that I can finally continue to work on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->clickinclock<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.com… but I did not actually work on it. But I clocked the time it took to prep my laptop @ <!-- raw HTML omitted -->clickinclock<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.com, cause I think that was a legit use of time.</p>
<p>Once I finally able to rip myself away from the laptop, I took <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jacque<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (my mom’s dog) out to run. We ran a total of 0.75 mi (after 0.5 mi, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jacque<!-- raw HTML omitted --> did not want to move anymore). I returned the dog, and ran another mile. I’m out of shape, but I really want to squeeze some exercise in before the Sweden trip.</p>
<p>Today’s Weight: 202 lbs</p>
<p>Then my mom came back home, and we had some salad, went to Goodwill, and then took <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jacque<!-- raw HTML omitted --> out one more time. Suddenly, it started thundering, and raining hard, and then hailing. On top of that, we had tornado warnings. It was crazy! But now everything is dying down, and that’s why I’m blogging.</p>
<p>I know my first post has been wordy, and may get <em>wordier</em> as time passes, but it’s a good experience for me to get what I want off my chest. So Thanks!</p>
<p>– E.T.</p>

                    <p>Dear Blog,
I had the best sleep I had in a long time today. I went to sleep at 1:30 AM and slept until 12:00 PM today. That only demonstrates how good it’s been!
When I woke up, I ran ~0.5 mi with Jacque and ran an extra 0.75 miles on my own. I’m feeling totally out of shape, and the sun beating down on me doesn’t help either.
Our friend Brian came into town tonight.</p>
