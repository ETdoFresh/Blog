                    <p>Dear Blog,</p>
<p>I figure Iâ€™d blog about my struggles with Palm Pre battery issues after certain updates!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>Where Iâ€™m Starting Off</strong></p>
<p>I bought a Palm Pre, flashed a custom firmware on it (qinray 1.0.4 v2). I then used novaterm to install Dropbear which is a SSH server for my phone so that I can just PuTTy and sFTP right into it. Then I setup ez-ipudate so that I could have a static hostname for my dynamic-IP address, so I only had to type myhostname.homeip.net instead of 123.45.54.32. All convenient, and never really had an issue. My phone would last me about 2 days without a charge.</p>
<p><strong>Before 1.3.5.1 â€“ Updating PRL</strong></p>
<p>The first time I encounter phone dying within one day problem with little or no usage was right around the 1.3 update. The solution I found to this was updating the PRL and disabling roaming. In weak signal areas, your phone keeps polling the area and draining your battery fast! Especially if you have roaming on (thatâ€™s a whole bunch of more places to poll).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So first easiest thing to try is disabling your roaming, which can be done right from your phone. Press your menu button on bottom of your phone, tap the phone icon, click your provider on top left of screen (most likely Sprint), tap Preferences, Drag down to the Network Section, Tap Voice Network, Select Sprint Only.</p>
<p>While youâ€™re there also try updating your PRL (Preferred Roaming List). Itâ€™ just a button almost at the dead bottom of the previous step.</p>
<p>If you canâ€™t update your PRL from your phone (like me), use computer software to update your PRLâ€¦ I wonâ€™t go into detail here, but overall: I find the latest PRL on the net (60659 during this post) and use QPSTâ€™s Service Programming -&gt; Roam Tab -&gt; Browse for my PRL and click Write to Phone. Done!</p>
<p><strong>The 1.3.5.1 Update</strong></p>
<p>Well I have lots of homebrew software as stated in my <em>Where Iâ€™m Starting</em> off section. I canâ€™t really tell you which step fixed my problem, but here goes my story. After about a week or two of charging my phone every night because battery dies within 1 day, I got fed up. This weekend, I was determined to find out what was wrong. But before that, I could not even turn on my phone with the A/C adapter plugged in! So I pop the battery out, wait about a minute, pop it back in, and it starts charging! Nice! But I was determined to find out what was wrong.</p>
<p>I read some forums online, and I noticed people without homebrew had significantly more post praising the battery life, where homebrewers like me were shunning the battery. So immediately I thought, it must be my homebrew software. At this point, I have an SSH, sFTP, and DynDNS on my phone. My focus immediately went to DynDNS. How often was it polling? I had no clue. So I added <em>period=86400</em> to <em>/opt/etc/ez-ipupdate.conf</em> to poll just once a day. This could have fixed my problem, but I delved deeper.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I then read this <a href="http://www.webos-internals.org/wiki/Application:Preware">post</a>, and installed Preware. I love Preware! I was doing everything by SSH before, but little did I know, this could be my last SSH session ever! I agreed to everything, and installed a few apps, like battery mointor, flashlight, etc. More imporantly, Preware didnâ€™t register I had software like Dropbear (SSH), and EZ-IPUpdate installed, so I just reinstalled them on top of my previous installs from Preware. Left the battery monitor software on over night last night. Woke up, and had only a 1.52% drop of battery per hour vs something like 8% â€“ 10%. Oh man! It was wonderful!</p>
<p>Oh, and I use GMAIL, Exchange, Wifi, and EVDO (email polls every 30 minutes).</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Iâ€™m excited about my new battery life, and maybe itâ€™s not Palmâ€™s fault entirely, but maybe us tweakers may be to blame (just little itty bitty bit). But once Palm learns to leave tweakerâ€™s settings alone, I think we can live in harmony! ðŸ™‚ Later!</p>
<p>â€“ ETdoFresh</p>
<p>PS â€“ Use <a href="http://www.webos-internals.org/wiki/Main_Page">WebOS Internals</a> for all your Homebrew needs! Very cool place!</p>

                    <p>Dear Blog,
Today in the mail, I got my Nike+ Sensor, and my Nike+ Sensor Pouch (what are the chances that Iâ€™d get them the same day?).
I unpacked it, and it was so small. I liked it! I immediately put it on my shoe.
I gave it a little test run around the house, and it seemed to do an OK job. But I then put it up to the real test.</p>
