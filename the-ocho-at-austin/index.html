                    <p>Dear Blog</p>
<p>Alright, alight! What’s up! It’s the end of Thursday (technically Friday) and I’m writing another blog. I woke up early today! 7:30AM! Very excited about that. And since I was up early, I decided to do something that may be cool (or not cool) for myself. I invested in stocks! Yay! Anyway, it was $3 a trade, and I always thought a trade consisted of multiple stocks, but i guess it just consist of trading one company (multiple shares). Sooo, I bought a boat load of stocks and hope my luck and instincts lead me the right way.</p>
<p>I tried running with Jacque today, but he did not want to budge when we got to the track. He was very finiky, so I pretended we were going home, but the other way, and he fell for it! We did it like twice, and then he caught on. I’d say we ran about 1/4 to 1/3 of a mile. Not too great, but hopefully good enough.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My bro picked me up at 12:30pm and we went to eat at the Bleu River Grille hosted by Texas Culinary Academy. It was a nice place with an amazing Cobe Burger. Lots of culinary students around. Then we walked over to his work, King’s isle, where I met all his crazy/cool co-workers. Nice place, and love the art and culture all over the office. Video game industry seems pretty awesome.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then I walked down to the Borders (a block away from where I was) so that my brother could return to work, and I could start on mine. I programmed the section in clickinclock.com where admin’s can add or delete users. So far no JavaScript, pure PHP. Well I lied, the only JavaScript is the time incrementing every second. I had nice black coffee for $2, and that lasted me the rest of the day as I sipped, sipped, and sipped.</p>
<p>After work we went over to the Daily Grill where it was Happy Hour. I had 2 beers, and lots of $2 – $3 plates, like Ahi Tuna, Calimari, and Hummus. Good stuff. We checked out the Apple store for a few minutes, and Apple has their stuff together. Everything is sleek, bright, and responsive. We should all take note, and apply it everywhere for some fierce competition.</p>
<p>At this point, we headed back home, had lotsa water, and some wine, and watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0456554/">Grandma’s Boy</a>. Very funny movie about a game tester who moves in with his Grandma.</p>
<p>Then we got the Wii to boot backed up games from a hard drive, or USB stick in my case. I really should remember the steps, so I’m posting a quick section right here. Run loadmii, or bootmii, and load DowngradeIOS35.dol. Using IOS36, install IOS35.wad using a wad manager. Then using IOS35, install cIOSv7.wad. Then with IOS249, install IOS36.wad (and HBC.wad if you don’t have homebrew yet). Restart the system, install IOS60patched.wad. Then install latest cIOS from <a href="http://www.teknoconsolas.es/blogs/waninkoko">Waninkoko’s blog</a>, which is cIOS38rev13b. Install a cool USB Loader, like USB Loader GX, or just USB Loader 1.5, and stick in your original Wii games, and copy them straight to the hard drive by clicking the ‘+’. Click on the DVD icon to download the cover, and boom. You got yourself your original Wii games on a hard drive. Save that poor DVD-Drive for later days.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While I was trying to get this all working, we played a bit of <a href="http://www.urbanterror.net/">Urban Terror</a>, a free, older First Person Shooter (FPS) where you run around and kill each other, like usual. You can capture the flag, deathmatch, etc. We played til’ really late (around now). So hopefully I can keep my waking up at decent hours in check. Wish me luck</p>

                    <p>Dear Blog,
I really don’t know what’s up with my sleeping habits. Another day, waking up between 11AM and 12PM. It can’t be the time I’m going to bed because I go to sleep like an hour after I post these blogs. And lately, they’ve been pretty early (like 11PM or 12AM).
Well, on with my day. I’ve been hanging out with my mom, since she stayed home from work due to her eye.</p>

                    <p>Dear Blog
Woke up at 10:30 AM, checked out my stocks, and still not in the positive (after fees that is). Commodities doing good, Apple went positive (I’m guessing due to the new phone).
My bro picked up for lunch, and we went to the coolest place ever. Taco Bell! Alright, it wasn’t the coolest place ever, but we went with his co-workers Robbie and Kerry. We had some food, and then I came back home to work on the website.</p>
