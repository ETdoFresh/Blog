I was dangerous enough with just the iPad Pro 2 and I simply loved the user experience, but was not my best self when using just the iPad.</description>

      <description>Today I have an iPad Pro 2, a Logitech Smart Keyboard and a pencil. First impressions here we go!
The Installation  This was quite easy. I just brought my iPhone close to my iPad, and then it just synced my account and downloaded all my apps from my iPhone to my iPad. Great time saver!
Goofing off I didn‚Äôt get the pencil and keyboard until mid-week. So all I found myself doing with my iPad when I first got it is watch videos/shows and play my iPhone games on a really big screen!</description>

      <description>The Current Situation I‚Äôm a computer programmer and a computer science master‚Äôs/PhD student. I‚Äôve decided to try an experiment to replace my existing 13.3‚Ä≥ HP Spectre x360 Windows Laptop (awesome laptop by the way) with the 12.9‚Ä≥ iPad Pro 2 . I plan to write a few blog posts that summarize my experience.
As far as Apple products go, I have an iPhone 7 Plus. It‚Äôs my only Apple product, and it has been a good purchase.</description>

      <description>I am currently working on software called Vector Animation (subject to change). The software will allow you to draw (or import), bone, animate, and test animations all in one place. The scope is big, but I am trying to avoid any bells or whistles.
Draw Mode 
Vector art has definitely taken hold of many media outlets, like games, websites, comics, etc. Instead of pixels, everything is drawn with lines, curves, polygons, and basic shapes.</description>

      <description>My Twitch stream is going to start October 2, 2017 6:00-7:00pm every Monday and Wednesday. I am going to be working on my Vector Animation program targeted mostly towards mobile platforms. Watch the exciting progress I make as I program live on twitch! Haha, ok, watching someone program can almost be considered crazy‚Ä¶ almost as crazy¬†recording it and streaming to the world wide web. :p
Also track my progress on Trello to see what will be discussed next stream:</description>

      <description>UPDATE 9/27/2017Wow! Rainwave.cc tweeted me back with a much better solution. Hence the post below is for educational purposed. Use the much better (and much more official) link below. üôÇ
 I love listening to video game remix music at¬†https://ocr.rainwave.cc, and wanted a way I can show on my stream the information about the current song being played.
I‚Äôm sure there are probably easier ways to do this, but I made a small windows GUI Executable using C#/WPF that will download Album, Title, and Art from rainwave‚Äôs API, and I wanted to share it with you.</description>

      <description>Here‚Äôs a little windows batch script for sharing your ‚Äúidea‚Äù or ‚Äúthought‚Äù videos that are perhaps too big for Discord. I use FFMPEG to reencode the video to under the 8MB limit.
I‚Äôve packaged this code and ffmpeg.exe together for easy distribution later.
Download 2DiscordVideo¬†[15.5MB]
Instructions: Drag YOUR.VIDEO onto 2DiscordVideo.cmd. Type in how many seconds your video is. It should then perform a 2 pass encoding of your video that will hopefully be less that 8MB.</description>

      <description>Before I knew the existence of Jitter Physics (which is what I‚Äôll end up using), I decided to try to make my own Physics Engine following Game Physics Engine Developmnet by Ian Millington, and basically got stuck somewhere when making¬†Contact Resolvers for Rigidbodies. However, I wanted to share my experience making Physics Engine, hopefully as briefly as I can while still making sense.

Yeah, MinGW¬†was kicking my butt‚Ä¶¬†I just threw my hands up, waved the white flag, and gave up. You may have saw¬†in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.etdofresh.com/add-freeglut-to-mingw/&#34;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; that we did get Freeglut working‚Ä¶ but once it came to glew32, it all came unglued.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;More setup! Joy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After setting up MinGW from our &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.etdofresh.com/setting-up-c-makefile-project-in-visual-studio/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, now we want to add a package called freeglut to our MinGW directory so we can some graphics to our programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download freeglut for MinGW from (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.transmissionzero.co.uk/computing/using-glut-with-mingw/&#34;&gt;http://www.transmissionzero.co.uk/computing/using-glut-with-mingw/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the contents into C:\MinGW (or wherever you installed MinGW)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK! Done!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;For my computer graphics course, I have to submit all my projects using C++, compiled using g++ and a Makefile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don‚Äôt know what a Makefile is, it‚Äôs basically a list of steps/depencies to get to the final product. For example, to end up with DogSimulator.exe, you will need to run g++ on DogSimulator.o and Dog.o (compiled objects). And the prerequisites to DogSimulator.o and Dog.o are¬†DogSimulator.cpp and Dog.cpp respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs not too hard in the terminal, because once you have all your files in the terminal, you just type ‚Äúmake‚Äù and the magic ensues. But I‚Äôm a snob for my Visual Studio IDE, so I am going to set it up there. Haha.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
