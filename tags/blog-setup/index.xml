      <description>Oh man. I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting so many hours trying to figure out how to move my blog over to Hugo/GitHub. I&amp;rsquo;m getting very close. I found a tool, WordPress to Hugo Exporter, which will hopefully get me going. I copied my WordPress site locally (here&amp;rsquo;s how), and now I&amp;rsquo;m running&amp;hellip;
/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter# mkdir tmp php hugo-export-cli.php ./tmp It just finished! Nice! Well, all my blog posts are over I think? Now I just have to spend hours formatting them.</description>

      <description>Introduction After 1 or 2 days, I realized slimming down from WordPress to Ghost was just the beginning. I was somewhat satisfied. However, after setting up comments and looking at other integrations for Ghost, I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m just using a mini/less functional WordPress. The markdown editing was the reason I made the switch, but then I realized, I might as well just scrap the database backend and keep all the files in a repo.</description>
