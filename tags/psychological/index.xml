      <description>So it’s been a while…
I switched gears, trying to find a calling that fits me. I’m still programming of course! I even got a job as a programmer in January! Woot! But my hobby is what drives me. I stopped working on the network physics engine and I started working on a vector animation software targeted for tablets. I feel like with this project I can finish in a semester and it can be a tool that can help game devs everywhere.</description>
