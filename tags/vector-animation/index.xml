      <description>My Twitch stream is going to start October 2, 2017 6:00-7:00pm every Monday and Wednesday. I am going to be working on my Vector Animation program targeted mostly towards mobile platforms. Watch the exciting progress I make as I program live on twitch! Haha, ok, watching someone program can almost be considered crazy… almost as crazy recording it and streaming to the world wide web. :p
Also track my progress on Trello to see what will be discussed next stream:</description>
