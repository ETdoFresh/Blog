      <description>Hi! I have realized I have not been writing in my blog. At all!
So, I decided to go crazy and switch from Wordpress to Ghost as my blogging platform! Hope it pays off! I&amp;rsquo;ll be working slowly but surely porting my old blog posts over here.
So, what have I been up to? Well, I really want to start putting myself out there digitally. So, I&amp;rsquo;m preparing steps to get out there.</description>

      <description>So it’s been a while…
I switched gears, trying to find a calling that fits me. I’m still programming of course! I even got a job as a programmer in January! Woot! But my hobby is what drives me. I stopped working on the network physics engine and I started working on a vector animation software targeted for tablets. I feel like with this project I can finish in a semester and it can be a tool that can help game devs everywhere.</description>
